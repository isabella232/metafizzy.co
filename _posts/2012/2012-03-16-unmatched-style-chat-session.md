[Gene Crawford](http://twitter.com/genecrawford), being a upstanding Southern gentleman, offered me a fine opportunity to do a chat session for his site [Unmatched Style](http://www.unmatchedstyle.com/). I graciously accepted. We got to talking about the history of Masonry, Isotope, and just what it is I do.

My thanks to Gene for putting this all together.

Also, sorry [Jonah](http://www.jonahgoldstein.com/site/) for totally blanking on your name.
